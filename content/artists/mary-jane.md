Mary Jane is a traveling artist who has been tattooing for over ten years.

She specialises in geometrical tattoos and prefers to do her tattoos one dot at the time a technique called dotwork.

Mary Jane loves to work with large scale projects like body suits, backpieces and sleeves to twist and modify the anatomy of the body, but does all sizes of geometrical tattoos.
